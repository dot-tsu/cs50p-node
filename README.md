I wanted to dive deeper into Node.js, so I decided to solve the CS50 Python problems using it instead! This repo contains my solutions to the CS50 problem sets and the final project, but with Node.js replacing Python.

I know it’s not the “standard” way to do it, but I found it to be a great way to practice and get better with Node.js while still working through the problems. Plus, it was fun to see how I could solve Python tasks in JavaScript!

> Even though these solutions were done with Node.js, the logic still sticks to the original problem’s core principles. This means if you're looking to understand how to approach these problems, the Node.js version should still make sense!

The goal wasn’t just to get the solutions but also to have fun and learn while exploring Node.js in a totally different way.
