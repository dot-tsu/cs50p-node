# CS50 Python with Node.js

  ![shirtificate](shirtificate.png)

I wanted to dive deeper into Node.js, so I decided to solve the CS50 Python problems using it instead! This repo contains my solutions to the CS50 problem sets and the final project, but with Node.js replacing Python.

I know it’s not the “standard” way to do it, but I found it to be a great way to practice and get better with Node.js while still working through the problems. Plus, it was fun to see how I could solve Python tasks in JavaScript!
